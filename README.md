# coffee-nes-ui

**coffee-nes-ui** is the accompanying UI for the [coffee-nes] emulator. Built with React, the app uses an HTML canvas to render the graphics. It attempts to run the emulation at 60fps but the actual speed will of course depend on your machine.

The UI allows the user to upload and run ROM files, define custom controller schemes, and control the flow of the emulation.

Fully functional but still a work in progress! So expect more updates (and a deployed version) in the near future.
